# vanhooff

Web design and development for Architect Studio Van Hooff. A single page with projects and an architect profile. The navigation is unfolded to emphasise a diversity of skills. The logo has been build out of blocks animated to deviate from their original location. A single column and uniform typeface styling keep this part of the web uncomplicated and functional.
